        Walks the 9-step bootstrap: <code>/office-hours</code> →{' '}
        <code>DESIGN.md</code> → CEO/eng/design plan reviews → architecture
        synthesis → design shotgun → reconciliation → scaffold. Built
        around the step you&apos;ll most want to skip.

        <strong>
          <code>/prompt-engineer</code>
        </strong>{' '}
        — <em>Use when you have a rough instruction and want a sharper
        Claude Code prompt.</em> Reads the actual repo first, asks up to
        four clarifying questions, then writes a prompt with verified file
        paths, framework-aware constraints, and explicit guardrails. No
        invented paths, no broad refactors.

          <code>/teach</code>
        </strong>{' '}
        — <em>Use when you want to actually understand something — a file,
        a concept, a library — instead of skim it.</em> Tutoring loop:
        overview → deep dive → user-driven follow-ups. Default depth is
        deep dive (you invoked this for a reason).

        </strong>{' '}
        — <em>Use when starting a new idea, before any planning.</em> Walks
        through six forcing questions (demand reality, status quo, desperate

          challenge scope, audience, and ambition.
        </em>{' '}
        Founder-mode review. Picks the right mode (SELECTIVE EXPANSION /
        HOLD / REDUCTION), flips audience priority if needed, cherry-picks

        and font + color preview pages.

        <strong>
          <code>/freeze</code>

        <strong>
          <code>/browse</code>
        </strong>{' '}

        before/after, test responsive layouts.

      <p>
        <strong>
          <code>/connect-chrome</code>
        </strong>{' '}
