Show the user this curated list of skills — both the personal `/GREEN` skills and the gstack ones — organized by category and labeled with both *when to use* and *what it does*. Present it cleanly — no extra commentary, no follow-up questions, no suggestions unless the user asks.

### Personal /GREEN skills

**`/greenfield`** — *Use when starting a brand new project from a vague idea.* Walks the 9-step bootstrap: `/office-hours` → `DESIGN.md` → CEO/eng/design plan reviews → architecture synthesis → design shotgun → reconciliation → scaffold. Built around the step you'll most want to skip.

**`/prompt-engineer`** — *Use when you have a rough instruction and want a sharper Claude Code prompt.* Reads the actual repo first, asks up to four clarifying questions, then writes a prompt with verified file paths, framework-aware constraints, and explicit guardrails. No invented paths, no broad refactors.

**`/teach`** — *Use when you want to actually understand something — a file, a concept, a library — instead of skim it.* Tutoring loop: overview → deep dive → user-driven follow-ups. Default depth is deep dive.

**`/audit`** — *Use when you think a project is ready to ship and want a final check.* 10 quality gates run sequentially — `/health`, `/qa`, dogfood, `/cso`, web quality, `/benchmark`, `/review`, `/codex`, `/design-review`, `/document-release`. Halts on dealbreakers, ship verdict at the end. Three tiers: quick / standard / full.

**`/design-html`** — *Use when you have an approved mockup, a plan, or a description and want real HTML/CSS.* Pretext-native output — text reflows, heights compute, layouts are dynamic. 30KB overhead, zero deps. Smart input detection picks up artifacts from `/design-shotgun`, `/plan-ceo-review`, or `/plan-design-review`.

**`/menu`** — *Use when you forgot which skill does what.* Prints this list — every skill you actually reach for, by phase, with when-to-use and what-each-does.

### Idea + planning

**`/office-hours`** — *Use when starting a new idea, before any planning.* Walks through six forcing questions (demand reality, status quo, desperate specificity, narrowest wedge, observation, future-fit). Catches premise problems early.

**`/plan-ceo-review`** — *Use when you have a draft `DESIGN.md` and need to challenge scope, audience, and ambition.* Founder-mode review. Picks the right mode (SELECTIVE EXPANSION / HOLD / REDUCTION), flips audience priority if needed, cherry-picks expansions for MVP.

**`/plan-eng-review`** — *Use after CEO review, before any code.* Eng manager-mode review of architecture, DB schema, race conditions, RLS, anti-cheat, test coverage, performance. **Required gate** — must be CLEAR before code starts.

**`/plan-design-review`** — *Use after eng review, before mockups exist.* Designer's eye plan review. Walks information architecture, state coverage, journey, mockup scope, AI-slop guardrails, design system, responsive + a11y.

**`/autoplan`** — *Use when you don't want to answer 15–30 intermediate questions.* Runs all three plan reviews sequentially with auto-decisions using six decision principles. Only stops at borderline taste decisions for your approval.

### Design

**`/design-consultation`** — *Use when starting a new product with no design system yet.* Researches your product landscape, proposes a complete design system (typography, color, layout, motion), generates `DESIGN.md` and font + color preview pages.

**`/design-shotgun`** — *Use when you don't know what a UI should look like and want to explore.* Generates multiple AI design variants, opens a comparison board, collects structured feedback, lets you iterate.

**`/design-review`** — *Use when a UI is built and live, before shipping.* Designer's eye QA on the running site. Catches visual inconsistency, spacing issues, hierarchy, AI-slop patterns, slow interactions. Iteratively fixes and re-verifies with before/after screenshots.

**`/brand-kit`** — *Use when a project needs an identity — name, mark, palette, type, app icons.* Reads project context deeply, generates THREE complete brand directions (different mark + palette + type voice for each) side-by-side in `brand-explore.html`, then commits to a single ~750-line `brand.html` with the chosen direction. Domain-driven SVG marks, app icon mockups (iOS / macOS / Android / browser), wordmark lockups, downloadable assets.

### During build

**`/investigate`** — *Use when something's broken and you don't know why.* Systematic four-phase debugging: investigate → analyze → hypothesize → implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause first.

**`/freeze`** — *Use when debugging and you want to stop yourself from accidentally editing unrelated code.* Restricts Edit and Write to a specific directory for the session.

**`/unfreeze`** — *Use to widen edit scope without ending the session.* Clears the freeze boundary; edits allowed everywhere again.

### Pre-merge / QA

**`/review`** — *Use right before merging a PR.* Analyzes diff against the base branch for SQL safety, LLM trust boundary violations, conditional side effects, structural issues.

**`/qa`** — *Use when a feature is ready for testing.* Systematic QA testing of a web app + iterative bug fixing. Each fix committed atomically and re-verified. Produces health scores, fix evidence, ship-readiness summary.

**`/browse`** — *Use when you need to test or dogfood a page programmatically.* Fast headless browser. Navigate URLs, interact with elements, take annotated screenshots, diff before/after, test responsive layouts.

**`/connect-chrome`** — *Use when you want to watch every browser action in real time.* Launches real Chrome controlled by gstack with the side panel extension auto-loaded. Live activity feed.

**`/setup-browser-cookies`** — *Use before QA-testing authenticated pages.* Imports cookies from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session via an interactive picker UI.
